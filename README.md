# docker-dev-firstspirit

Local FirstSpirit development environment using Docker and ngrok.

This setup enables you to run a FirstSpirit server locally and expose it securely over HTTPS using your **ngrok custom domain**.

> **Note:** The official FirstSpirit Docker image is secured. You must authenticate with FirstSpirit's Docker registry to use it.

## üîß Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account with a **custom domain**
- Valid `fs-license.conf` file from FirstSpirit
- Docker credentials for `docker.artifactory.e-spirit.hosting`

cp conf/ngrok/ngrok.yml.example conf/ngrok/ngrok.yml
```

2. **Update values:**

- `.env`: Add your Docker credentials for FirstSpirit's registry
- `fs-server.conf`: Replace all references to `your-ngrok-domain.ngrok-free.app` with your **custom ngrok domain**
- `ngrok.yml`: Set your `authtoken` and `domain`

3. **Place your FirstSpirit license file:**

```bash
mv your-fs-license.conf conf/firstspirit/fs-license.conf

```bash
./start.sh
```
